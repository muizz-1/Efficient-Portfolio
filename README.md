# Efficient Portfolio of Stocks and Gold

This project applies **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to build an **efficient portfolio** using a combination of selected stocks and gold. It uses **Python**, **SciPy**, and **Matplotlib** to compute and visualize the efficient frontier, simulate random portfolios, and determine the optimal portfolio allocation.  

---

## Features
- Load and process historical price data for stocks and gold.  
- Compute expected returns, volatility, and covariance of assets.  
- Generate and evaluate thousands of random portfolios.  
- Use **SciPy optimization** to calculate the efficient frontier.  
- Identify the **maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio**.  
- Visualize portfolios and results with **Matplotlib**.

## Usage
1. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2.  Run the script:
    python portfolio.py
3. View results in the terminal and generated plots.
